# CH02 : Introduction to C language 

`C is a general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Ritchie created C as a low-level language that could be used to write efficient and portable system software.`

### Variable : 
- `A variable is an identifier or a name which is used to refer a value and this value varies or changes during the program execution.`<br>
*example* : *name = tomba , surname = laisharam, age=12*
- `How to declare a variable in C ?`
  - We use a data type specifier along with the variable
     - e.g : `int age ;` , *int is a data type for interger and age is the name of variable*
