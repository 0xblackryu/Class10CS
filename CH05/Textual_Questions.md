# SECTION A: REVIEW QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Explain with an example a `for` loop used in C 
2. Write a C program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. Write a C program to find the sum of all even integers between 2 and `n`. 
4. Write a C program to print integers from 1 to 50, five integers per line. Explain the working of the program. 
5. The frequency `n` of a vibrating string which depends on length. 1, tension T. and linear density is given by <br>
$n = \frac{k}{l} \sqrt{\frac{T}{m}}$
where is a constant. Write a C program to find `n` when 1=50, 60, 70 and 80 cm. 
6. Write a C program to generate and print the numbers between 100 and 200 which are divisible by 3. but not divisible by 4.
7. Write a C program to print the individual digits of a 6-digit number. 
8. Write a C program to find the sum of the individual digits of a N digit number and check whether it is odd or even. 
9. Write a C program to print Armstrong numbers from 100 to 999.
10. Write a C program to test whether a given number is a palindrome nuniber. Explain the working of the program. 
(An integer is said to be a palindrome if it doesn must change when the order of digits in the integer is reversed. For example 321454123, 536635 are palindromes) 
11. Write a C program to accept an integer number between 1 and 9. Write the value of the mumber in words. 
12. Write a C program to print the prime numbers between 100 and 1000. 
13. Write a C program to check if the given number is a perfect number. 
(A number is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its factors is equal to the given number. For example, 6 is a perfect number (factors of 6 are 12 and 3: adding the factors we get 1+2+3=6). 
14. Write a C program which will print the factorial of all numbers from 1 to 15.
15. The numbers in the sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 are called fibonacci numbers. Write a program in C using a `do-while` loop to calculate and print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
16. Write a C program to evaluate the series <br>
$1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \ldots$
up to 15 terms.

<pre>
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7
          1 2 3 4 5
            1 2 3
              1
</pre>
Explain the working of the program.
