`Format specifier are used to specify the format of a variable or other while using input or output functions`
<br>

Some format specifier are :
<br>

| Format Specifier | Description                                                  | Function                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `%e` or `%E`     | Floating-point number in scientific notation             | Prints or reads a floating-point number in scientific notation. |
| `%g` or `%G`     | Floating-point number in the more compact of `%f` or `%e` | Prints or reads a floating-point number in the more compact of `%f` or `%e`. |
| `%c`             | Single character                                          | Prints or reads a single character.                         |

## printf() function

`printf() function is used to print/display values of variables using the standart input/output device(monitor).`
<br>


*syntax* : `printf("format string",V1,V2,Vn);`

where V1,V2 ... Vn are variables whose values are to be displayed in the monitor. "format string" is the control string which represents the format specification (refer to format specifiers).

### Example 
```c
printf(" %f ",s);
printf("\n sum = %6.2f ",s);
printf("\n %d factorial is %d",k,kfact);
```
When these functions are executed, the computer prints/display the values of the variables listed in printf().<br>
Consider value s = 2.8, k = 5 and kfact = 120.

```
2.800000
sum = 2.80
5 factorial is 120
```

---

## scanf() function

`scanf() function is used to read/input values of variables using the standard input device(keyboard).`
<br>

*syntax* : `scanf("format string",&V1,&V2 ... &Vn);`

Where V1, V2 ... Vn are variable whose values are to be read form the keyboard.<br>"format string" is the control string which represents the format specification (refer to format specifier ).<br>
The symbol `&`(ampersand) represents the memory address where the variable value is to be stored.


### Example
```c
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b); // to read value of int variables a and b.
scanf("%f %d", &x, &n); // to read float value of x and int value of n.
scanf("%c",&gender); // to read char value for the variable gender.
scanf("%s",sname); // to read a string of char variable sname.
```

When these functions are executed, the computer will wait for the values of the variable listed in scanf which are to be entered using keyboard.
