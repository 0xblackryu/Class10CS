# SECTION A: REVIEW QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES
1. Explain the various **if** structures available in C.

Ans : 
```
The various if structures are :
i. Simple if statement  : the if statement is used for the selection of one statement based on condition.
   The if statement will start with the evaluation of the given expression.
   The syntax of if statement is :
        if (condition)
          {
            Statement
          }

ii. If-else statement : if-else statement is used if the condition is true, the statement associated with the if part will be executed. If the condtion
    is false, the statement associated with the else part will be executed.
    The syntax of if-else is :
    if (condition)
    {
        True block
    }
    else 
    {
        False Block
    }

iii. Nested if-else statement : An if statement may have another if statement in a true block and false block. These compound statement are called nested if statement.
     The syntax of nested if-else statemnt is :
      if (condition 1)
{
  if (condition 2)
    {
        --------------
        <true block 1>
        --------------
    }
   else
    {
        -------------
        <false block 1>
        -------------
    }
}
else
{
  if (condition 3)
    {
      --------------
      <true block 2>
      --------------
    }
  else
    {
      ---------------
      <false block 2>
      ---------------
    }
}
  
```


2. Write notes on (i) conditional statement (ii) **switch** statement

Ans : 
```
i. Conditional Statement : Conditional Statement are used to execute/transfer the control from one part of the program to another depending on a condition.
   There are two types of conditional statement used in C language : 
      a. if-else statement. 
      b. switch statement.
ii. Switch Statement : The switch statement are substitude for a long if-else statement. Switch statment is used to
    execute a block of statement depending on the value of a variable or expression.
```

3. Discuss the difference between **if...else** and **switch** structures.<br>

Ans : 
| If-else | Switch |
| ------- | ------ |
| i. if else statement uses condition to execute a block of statement. | i. Switch statement uses a single expression or value of a variable to execute a block of statement | 
| ii. It's keywords are if, else and else if | ii. It's keywords are switch, case and default |
| iii. It can contain multiple condition using logical operators | Each case can contain only one value | 


4. Explain with example the if statement and nested if statement in C.<br>

Ans : 
```
i. If statement : if statement is used to execute a statement block or a single statement depending on the value of a condition
   Example :
         int mark = 50;
         if (mark < 40){
            printf("Failed\n");
         }
         else {
            printf("Passed")
         }
   In the following code the else part will be executed because mark is more than 40.

ii. Nested if-else statement : An if statement may have another if statement in the <true block> and <false block>.This compound statement is called nested if statement.
    Example :
      int mark = 95;
      if (mark > 40 ) {
         if (mark > 90)
               printf("Grade : A");
            else {
                  printf("Grade : B");
               }
      }
      else {
         printf("Grade : F");
      }
      In the following code the grade will be printed as A because the grade is greater than 40 and 90.
```

5. Write a C program to find the smallest of given two numbers.<br>

Ans :
```c
#include <conio.h> //remove if not using turboc++ compiler
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
   int a, b, big;

   clrscr() //remove if not using turboc++

   scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);

   if (a>b){
   big = a;
   }
   else {
   big = b;
   }
   printf("Biggest number : %d\n",big);
   getch() // remove if not using turboc++
   return 0;
}
```

7. Write a C program to find the smallest of given three numbers. <br>
Ans :
```c
#include <conio.h> //remove if not using turboc++
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a, b, c, big;

   clrscr() //remove if not using turboc++

   if (a>b){
      if (a>c){
            big = a;
         }
      else{
         big = c;
         }
   }
   else {
      if (b>c){
            big = b;
            }
      else {
            big = c;
         }
   }
   printf("Biggest number : %d\n",big);
   getch() // remove if not using turboc++
   return 0;
}
```


9. Write a C program to find the average of best three marks from the given four test marks.

[Hint: Find the smallest of given four test marks. Subtract it from the sum of four test marks. You will now get the sum of best three marks. Take the average

i.e., average = $(T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 - smallest)/ 3$ <br>

Ans : 
```c
#include <conio.h> //remove if not using turboc++ compiler
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

   int t1, t2, t3, t4, smallNum; 
   float avr;

   clrscr() ; //remove if not using turboc++

   printf("Enter the four marks : ");
   scanf("%d %d %d %d",&t1, &t2, &t3, &t4);

   smallNum = t1 ; // setting the small number is t1

   if (t2 < smallNum){
      smallNum = t2; // if t2 was less than smallNum then the value of smallNum is set to the value of t2
   }
   if (t3 < smallNum){
      smallNum = t3; // if t3 was less than smallNum then the value of smallNum is set to the value of t3
   }
   if (t4 < smallNum){
      smallNum = t4; // if t4 was less than smallNum then the value of smallNum is set to the value of t4
   }

   avr = (t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 - smallNum) / 3.0 ;

   printf("Average of best three marks : %.2f\n",avr);
   getch(); //remove if not using turboc++
   return 0;

}
```

8. Write a C program that will read the value of x and evaluate the function <br>
y(x) = xÂ² + 2x - 10 if x < 10 <br>
= |x|               if x < 0
using a **if** statement.<br>

Ans : 
```c

#include <conio.h> //remove if not using turboc++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h> // for absolute value of x or for fabs() func 

int main() {

   float x, y;

   clrscr() //remove if not using turboc++

   printf("Enter value of x : ");
   scanf("%f",&x);

   if (x>10){
      y = x*x + 2*x - 10; // set the value of y to the value of this expression if x is less than 10;  
   }
   if (x<0){
      y = fabs(x); // set the absolute value of x to y if x is less than 0 meaning negative numbers;
   }

   printf("Value of y : %.2f\n",y);
   getch(); //remove if not using turboc++
   return 0;
}

```
