# CH01 : Algorithm for Problem Solving 

`RECOMMANDED TO READ THE Algorithm.txt AS IT HAS EXPLAINATION WITH SOME DETAILS`

## Overview 
- `Swapping two values` : *use another variable to store the value of a variable1 then replace the value of the variable 1
                        with value of variable 2 then replace the value of the variable 2 with value of variable 3.*
- `Biggest Number between 2 number` : *use another variable big , if value of variable1 > variable2 then big = variable1 else big = variable2*
- `Farenheit (°F) to Celsuis (°C)` : *use a variable ces = 5/9 (°F - 32) , where °F is the given farenheit ... <br>`Formula : 5/9 (°F - 32)`*
- `Sum of n natural number` : *use i=0, sum=0 and we will use while loop untill i is not equal to n and inside the loop we will add sum and i and i + 1* example :<br> *while i != n <br> sum = sum + i <br> i = i + 1*
- `FACTORIAL of n term OR Product of n natural number` : *use i=0, pro=1 and we will use while loop untill i is not equal to n and inside the loop we will multiply pro and i and i + 1* <br>example :<br> *while i != n <br> pro = pro * i <br> i = i + 1*
- `Reverse digit of a given number` : *use two variable lastdigit and reverse , let n = 123 now we assign lastdigit = n % 10 , % give remainder of a division now we will loop through a while loop , while n is greater than 0 we will assign reverse = reverse * 10 + lastdigit then we will again assign lastdigit = n % 10 and lastly we reduce n by dividing it by 10*<br> example :<br> *lastdigit=n%10<br>while n>0<br>reverse = reverse * 10 + lastdigit<br>n = n/10*
