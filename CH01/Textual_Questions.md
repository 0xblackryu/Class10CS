# REVIEW QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES

1. Write the algorithm and draw the flowchart to find the average of given 3 values.

2. Write the algorithm and draw the flowchart to find the area and circumference of a circle of radius r.

[**Hint**: Area= πr²; Circumference = 2πr]

3. Write the algorithm and draw the flowchart to convert the temperature given in °c to °f.

[**Hint**: Use the relation °f= 1.8°c +32]

4. Draw the flowchart to find the smallest of the given three numbers.

5. Draw the flowchart to solve the following series which is the summation of cosine series <br>
$s = x - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots \infty$ neglecting the terms which are less that 10^-4 in magnitude.

[Hint: The method discussed in Example 8 can be used to solve this series with minor changes.]

6. Draw the flowchart to find the sum of natural numbers upto N.

[Hint: The method discussed in Example 10 can be used to solve the series, i.e. $s = 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 + ... + N$.]

7. Draw a flowchart to solve the following series:

$$s = 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \cdots + \frac{1}{N!}$$

8. Draw a flowchart to solve the following series: <br>
$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \cdots$$ ∞ <br>
Neglect the terms which are less than 10 in magnitude.
